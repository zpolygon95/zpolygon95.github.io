Found at [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org), Square's annual public CTF has a
Unix MAN page aesthetic that is very cool, and persistent hosing for past year's
events! Check out [squarectf.com](https://squarectf.com/2018) for a complete
list of problems, the story behind the problems, and for write-ups of the
problems that I didn't get to!

I seem to be getting at least marginally better at this, so hopefully the
write-ups below are useful to somebody.

## Problems ##

+ [dot-n-dash](C1): A fun little encoding problem
+ [shredded](C3): [Exactly what you'd expect](shredded.gif)
+ [captcha](C8): My white whale
