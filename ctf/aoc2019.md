# Advent of Code 2019 #

As the name implies, this event is an advent calendar with puzzles instead of
candy. It's not *precicely* a CTF, but close enough for me! I write this as I'm
in the final weeks of my undergraduate career, so I'm willing to bend the rules
a bit to participate in this adorably well-themed event! I'm a sucker for good
themes, and especially events with great visual design. This one has a very nice
looking fullscreen terminal app style.

Being an advent calendar, there are 25 days of puzzles -- each of which
sequentially unlock at midnight EST. I came in a few days late, so I had to do
the first few days of puzzles all at once:

There is a lot of prose in the problem descriptions, so I'm just going to
paraphrase and summarize rather than copy the entire prompt into these articles.
And, since the problems have been relatively quick so far, I'll separate them
into 5 groups of 5 days each:

+ [Week 1](/ctf/aoc2019/w1)
    + [Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](/ctf/aoc2019/w1#d1)
    + [Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm](/ctf/aoc2019/w1#d2)
    + [Day 3: Crossed Wires](/ctf/aoc2019/w1#d3)
    + [Day 4: Secure Container](/ctf/aoc2019/w1#d4)
    + [Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids](/ctf/aoc2019/w1#d5)
