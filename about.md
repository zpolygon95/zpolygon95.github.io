Hi, I'm Zofia! I use they/them or she/her pronouns. I like computers, and
somehow I've convinced various companies to pay me to play around with their
computers for about the last decade or so, and I've been having a good time with
that.

I also like all sorts of music, science fiction novels, heist movies, and the
Oxford comma. Unfortunately, I haven't yet convinced any companies to pay me to
read Discworld books all day...

If you want to talk with me about computers or anything else, just aim your
email launcher at any old username at this domain, it'll find me eventually! The
silliest guesses get extra points!

If you like security and privacy, or you're just a fan of being sneaky, you can
use [this key][1] to give your email launcher superpowers:
