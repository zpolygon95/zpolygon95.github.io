My name is Zachary James Polikarpus, though I prefer to be called "Zac". I'm
currently employed by [Cypress Integration Solutions][1] as a "Product
Engineer" (that's what it says on my business card, anyway). I'm interested in
security, privacy, and cryptography, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's
degree in computer science from the [University of Michigan Flint Campus][2].

I spend most of my days writing firmware for Cypress products in assembly
language, and writing tools to test and support those products in python. I
spend the rest of my days in class, playing [CTF][4] (poorly), and being
simultaneously amazed at the pace of technological improvement and frustrated
by how poorly some of it is implemented.
