I'm a little late to the party, but I heard about this from a fellow student,
and it happened to occur during a very hectic time for me personally. Still, I
wanted to work on it because it seemeed cute and fun!

<h2 id="d1">Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation</h2>

The first challenge is clearly about the [Rocket Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation).

Part one challenge:

> ...At the first Go / No Go poll, every Elf is Go until the Fuel Counter-Upper.
> They haven't determined the amount of fuel required yet.
>
> Fuel required to launch a given **module** is based on its **mass**.
> Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by
> three, round down, and subtract 2.
>
> ...
>
> **What is the sum of the fuel requirements** for all of the modules on your
> spacecraft?

Ok, easy enough:

```python
>>> def rocket_fuel(mass):
...     return (mass // 3) - 2
```

I attempted to use the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
module to get my puzzle input, but...

```python
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get('https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1/input')
<Response [400]>
>>> _.text
'Puzzle inputs differ by user.  Please log in to get your puzzle input.\n'
```

Well shoot, It might be easier just to copy-paste the puzzle input into the
interpreter...

```python
>>> text = """125860
... <pasted puzzle input>
... 132329
... 65057"""

>>> text
'125860\n66059\n147392\n64447\n72807\n136018\n144626\n68233\n130576\n92645\n52805\n79642\n74361\n98270\n110796\n62578\n58421\n125079\n52683\n144885\n148484\n113638\n125026\n112534\n125479\n51539\n122007\n60048\n67923\n76115\n144822\n115991\n133505\n85249\n142441\n90211\n87022\n68196\n117577\n58112\n116865\n108253\n127674\n93302\n58817\n126794\n89824\n134386\n99700\n125855\n119753\n64456\n68167\n88047\n127864\n146890\n71912\n128375\n134365\n91544\n104179\n84700\n95937\n78409\n94604\n130423\n98348\n87489\n105103\n94794\n123723\n134298\n88283\n59543\n53645\n89325\n109301\n143668\n96250\n130371\n140436\n95857\n98543\n91372\n137056\n142578\n116185\n96588\n93025\n122275\n99201\n110492\n109700\n106755\n120979\n60957\n134983\n130840\n132329\n65057'

>>> sum(rocket_fuel(int(x)) for x in text.split())
3427947
```

Which turns out to have been the correct answer for my input.

Part two challenge:

> During the second Go / No Go poll, the Elf in charge of the Rocket Equation
> Double-Checker stops the launch sequence. Apparently, you forgot to include
> additional fuel for the fuel you just added.
>
> Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, divide by three,
> round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel **also** requires fuel, and
> **that** fuel requires fuel, and so on. Any mass that would require
> **negative fuel** should instead be treated as if it requires **zero fuel**;
> the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by **wishing really hard**,
> which has no mass and is outside the scope of this calculation.
>
> So, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total. Then,
> treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat the
> process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative.
>
> ...
>
> **What is the sum of the fuel requirements** for all of the modules on your
> spacecraft when also taking into account the mass of the added fuel?
> (Calculate the fuel requirements for each module separately, then add them all
> up at the end.)

Ok, how about this

```python
>>> answer = _
>>> extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(answer)
... while extra_fuel > 0:
...     answer += extra_fuel
...     extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)

>>> answer
5141879
```

Nope! That would be too easy. How about this?

```python
>>> def calculate_rocket_fuel(module_masses):
...     def rocket_fuel(mass):
...         return (mass // 3) - 2
...     initial_fuel_requirement = sum(rocket_fuel(mass) for mass in module_masses)
...     total_fuel = initial_fuel_requirement
...     extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(initial_fuel_requirement)
...     while extra_fuel > 0:
...         total_fuel += extra_fuel
...         extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)
...     return total_fuel

>>> calculate_rocket_fuel(int(x) for x in text.split())
5141879
```

Still no... Hmm... Oh! I'm supposed to calculate the fuel requirements for each
module separately according to the challenge text.

```python
>>> def calculate_rocket_fuel(module_masses):
...     def rocket_fuel(mass):
...         return (mass // 3) - 2
...     total_fuel = 0
...     for mass in module_masses:
...         initial_fuel_requirement = rocket_fuel(mass)
...         module_fuel = initial_fuel_requirement
...         extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(initial_fuel_requirement)
...         while extra_fuel > 0:
...             module_fuel += extra_fuel
...             extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)
...         total_fuel += module_fuel
...     return total_fuel

>>> calculate_rocket_fuel(int(x) for x in text.split())
5139037
```

That did it! Now we have the correct amount of fuel, and we're one step closer
to saving Santa!
