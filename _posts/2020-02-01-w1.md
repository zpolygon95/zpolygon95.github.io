I'm a little late to the party, but I heard about this from a fellow student,
and it happened to occur during a very hectic time for me personally. Still, I
wanted to work on it because it seemeed cute and fun!

<h2 id="d1">Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation</h2>

The first challenge is clearly about the [Rocket Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation).

Part one challenge:

> ...At the first Go / No Go poll, every Elf is Go until the Fuel Counter-Upper.
> They haven't determined the amount of fuel required yet.
>
> Fuel required to launch a given **module** is based on its **mass**.
> Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by
> three, round down, and subtract 2.
>
> ...
>
> **What is the sum of the fuel requirements** for all of the modules on your
> spacecraft?

Ok, easy enough:

```python
>>> def rocket_fuel(mass):
...     return (mass // 3) - 2
```

I attempted to use the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
module to get my puzzle input, but...

```python
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get('https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1/input')
<Response [400]>
>>> _.text
'Puzzle inputs differ by user.  Please log in to get your puzzle input.\n'
```

Well shoot, It might be easier just to copy-paste the puzzle input into the
interpreter...

```python
>>> text = """125860
... <pasted puzzle input>
... 132329
... 65057"""

>>> text
'125860\n66059\n147392\n64447\n72807\n136018\n144626\n68233\n130576\n92645\n52805\n79642\n74361\n98270\n110796\n62578\n58421\n125079\n52683\n144885\n148484\n113638\n125026\n112534\n125479\n51539\n122007\n60048\n67923\n76115\n144822\n115991\n133505\n85249\n142441\n90211\n87022\n68196\n117577\n58112\n116865\n108253\n127674\n93302\n58817\n126794\n89824\n134386\n99700\n125855\n119753\n64456\n68167\n88047\n127864\n146890\n71912\n128375\n134365\n91544\n104179\n84700\n95937\n78409\n94604\n130423\n98348\n87489\n105103\n94794\n123723\n134298\n88283\n59543\n53645\n89325\n109301\n143668\n96250\n130371\n140436\n95857\n98543\n91372\n137056\n142578\n116185\n96588\n93025\n122275\n99201\n110492\n109700\n106755\n120979\n60957\n134983\n130840\n132329\n65057'

>>> sum(rocket_fuel(int(x)) for x in text.split())
3427947
```

Which turns out to have been the correct answer for my input.

Part two challenge:

Ok, how about this

```python
>>> answer = _
>>> extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(answer)
... while extra_fuel > 0:
...     answer += extra_fuel
...     extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)

>>> answer
5141879
```

Nope! That would be too easy. How about this?

```python
>>> def calculate_rocket_fuel(module_masses):
...     def rocket_fuel(mass):
...         return (mass // 3) - 2
...     initial_fuel_requirement = sum(rocket_fuel(mass) for mass in module_masses)
...     total_fuel = initial_fuel_requirement
...     extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(initial_fuel_requirement)
...     while extra_fuel > 0:
...         total_fuel += extra_fuel
...         extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)
...     return total_fuel

>>> calculate_rocket_fuel(int(x) for x in text.split())
5141879
```

Still no... Hmm... Oh! I'm supposed to calculate the fuel requirements for each
module separately according to the challenge text.

```python
>>> def calculate_rocket_fuel(module_masses):
...     def rocket_fuel(mass):
...         return (mass // 3) - 2
...     total_fuel = 0
...     for mass in module_masses:
...         initial_fuel_requirement = rocket_fuel(mass)
...         module_fuel = initial_fuel_requirement
...         extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(initial_fuel_requirement)
...         while extra_fuel > 0:
...             module_fuel += extra_fuel
...             extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)
...         total_fuel += module_fuel
...     return total_fuel

>>> calculate_rocket_fuel(int(x) for x in text.split())
5139037
```

That did it! Now we have the correct amount of fuel, and we're one step closer
to saving Santa!

<h2 id="d2">Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm</h2>

> On the way to your *gravity assist* around the Moon, your ship computer beeps

Ha! Must have hit the [HCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire)
instruction. Anyway, I imagine we're supposed to do something about this... The
rest of the puzzle prompt details the operation of an "Intcode Computer". We're
supposed to implement a new one, and...

> Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity
> assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had
> just before the last computer caught fire. To do this,
> **before running the program**, replace position 1 with the value 12 and
> replace position 2 with the value 2. **What value is left at position 0**
> after the program halts?

Ok, first thing's first, condense the spec for Intcode:
1. Intcode programs consist of a one dimensional list of integers
   + Each element is called a "position"
   + Positions are numbered starting from 0
   + Input files are decimal encoded, separated by commas and arbitrary amounts
     of whitespace (including line breaks)
2. Execution begins at position 0
3. Positions may be treated either as an "opcode", or an argument to an opcode.
4. Opcode 1 accepts three arguments (in the next three positions): a, b, c
   + arguments represent positions
   + `c = a + b`
5. Opcode 2 behaves exactly like opcode 1, except `c = a * b`
6. Opcode 99 accepts no arguments, and causes the program to halt.
7. Other opcodes are illegal

Let's jump right in. First, we learn from our mistakes in day one by saving the
puzzle input to a file. Next, parse the puzzle input:

```python
def parse_intcode(text):
    return [int(x.strip()) for x in text.split(',')]

with open('day2.txt') as f:
    prog = parse_intcode(f.read())
```

Ok, next we implement the intcode interpreter:

```python
def execute_intcode(prog):
    pos = 0
    while True:
        opcode = prog[pos]
        if opcode == 1:
            a, b, c = prog[pos + 1:pos + 4]
            prog[c] = prog[a] + prog[b]
        elif opcode == 2:
            a, b, c = prog[pos + 1:pos + 4]
            prog[c] = prog[a] * prog[b]
        elif opcode == 99:
            break
        else:
            raise ValueError(f'Invalid opcode {opcode} at {pos}')
        pos += 4
```

Since the program is self-modifying, we should save the original state in case
we mess it up.

```python
prog_orig = [i for i in prog]
```

The last part of the puzzle text asks us to modify position 1 with the value 12,
and position 2 with the value 2 before we run the program.

```python
prog[1] = 12
prog[2] = 2
```

And finally, let's try it out!

```python
>>> execute_intcode(prog)
>>> prog[0]
12490719
```

Yay, That was correct! On to part 2...

> "Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! **Keep it nearby**
> during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers
> support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they
> are as you need them."

The next prompts define some terminology, and then lay out the next part of the
challenge:

> "With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the
> gravity assist, you need to **determine what pair of inputs produces the output**
> `19690720`."

The inputs to the program are the values at positions 1 (called the **noun**)
and 2 (called the **verb**), as given in part one, and they can range between 0
and 99, inclusive. The program output is in position 0 after the program halts.

The final answer to the puzzle is `100 * noun + verb`

So, this seems to be a brute force problem. There are two input symbols with 100
possible values each, so there are `100 ** 2 == 10000` combinations of input...

Let's get started!

```python
def brute_force(prog, val):
    from itertools import permutations
    for noun, verb in permutations(range(100), 2):
        prog_copy = [i for i in prog]
        prog_copy[1] = noun
        prog_copy[2] = verb
        execute_intcode(prog_copy)
        out = prog_copy[0]
        if out == val:
            return 100 * noun + verb
    return None
```

And, let's try it...

```python
>>> brute_force(prog_orig, 19690720)
2003
```

Hooray! Our gravity assist around the Moon was successful.
