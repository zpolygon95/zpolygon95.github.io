I'm a little late to the party, but I heard about this from a fellow student,
and it happened to occur during a very hectic time for me personally. Still, I
wanted to work on it because it seemeed cute and fun!

<h2 id="d1">Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation</h2>

The first challenge is clearly about the [Rocket Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation).

Part one challenge:

> ...At the first Go / No Go poll, every Elf is Go until the Fuel Counter-Upper.
> They haven't determined the amount of fuel required yet.
>
> Fuel required to launch a given **module** is based on its **mass**.
> Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by
> three, round down, and subtract 2.
>
> ...
>
> **What is the sum of the fuel requirements** for all of the modules on your
> spacecraft?

Ok, easy enough:

```python
>>> def rocket_fuel(mass):
...     return (mass // 3) - 2
```

I attempted to use the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
module to get my puzzle input, but...

```python
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get('https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1/input')
<Response [400]>
>>> _.text
'Puzzle inputs differ by user.  Please log in to get your puzzle input.\n'
```

Well shoot, It might be easier just to copy-paste the puzzle input into the
interpreter...

```python
>>> text = """125860
... <pasted puzzle input>
... 132329
... 65057"""

>>> text
'125860\n66059\n147392\n64447\n72807\n136018\n144626\n68233\n130576\n92645\n52805\n79642\n74361\n98270\n110796\n62578\n58421\n125079\n52683\n144885\n148484\n113638\n125026\n112534\n125479\n51539\n122007\n60048\n67923\n76115\n144822\n115991\n133505\n85249\n142441\n90211\n87022\n68196\n117577\n58112\n116865\n108253\n127674\n93302\n58817\n126794\n89824\n134386\n99700\n125855\n119753\n64456\n68167\n88047\n127864\n146890\n71912\n128375\n134365\n91544\n104179\n84700\n95937\n78409\n94604\n130423\n98348\n87489\n105103\n94794\n123723\n134298\n88283\n59543\n53645\n89325\n109301\n143668\n96250\n130371\n140436\n95857\n98543\n91372\n137056\n142578\n116185\n96588\n93025\n122275\n99201\n110492\n109700\n106755\n120979\n60957\n134983\n130840\n132329\n65057'

>>> sum(rocket_fuel(int(x)) for x in text.split())
3427947
```

Which turns out to have been the correct answer for my input.

Part two challenge:

Ok, how about this

```python
>>> answer = _
>>> extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(answer)
... while extra_fuel > 0:
...     answer += extra_fuel
...     extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)

>>> answer
5141879
```

Nope! That would be too easy. How about this?

```python
>>> def calculate_rocket_fuel(module_masses):
...     def rocket_fuel(mass):
...         return (mass // 3) - 2
...     initial_fuel_requirement = sum(rocket_fuel(mass) for mass in module_masses)
...     total_fuel = initial_fuel_requirement
...     extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(initial_fuel_requirement)
...     while extra_fuel > 0:
...         total_fuel += extra_fuel
...         extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)
...     return total_fuel

>>> calculate_rocket_fuel(int(x) for x in text.split())
5141879
```

Still no... Hmm... Oh! I'm supposed to calculate the fuel requirements for each
module separately according to the challenge text.

```python
>>> def calculate_rocket_fuel(module_masses):
...     def rocket_fuel(mass):
...         return (mass // 3) - 2
...     total_fuel = 0
...     for mass in module_masses:
...         initial_fuel_requirement = rocket_fuel(mass)
...         module_fuel = initial_fuel_requirement
...         extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(initial_fuel_requirement)
...         while extra_fuel > 0:
...             module_fuel += extra_fuel
...             extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)
...         total_fuel += module_fuel
...     return total_fuel

>>> calculate_rocket_fuel(int(x) for x in text.split())
5139037
```

That did it! Now we have the correct amount of fuel, and we're one step closer
to saving Santa!

<h2 id="d2">Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm</h2>

> On the way to your *gravity assist* around the Moon, your ship computer beeps

Ha! Must have hit the [HCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire)
instruction. Anyway, I imagine we're supposed to do something about this... The
rest of the puzzle prompt details the operation of an "Intcode Computer". We're
supposed to implement a new one, and...

> Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity
> assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had
> just before the last computer caught fire. To do this,
> **before running the program**, replace position 1 with the value 12 and
> replace position 2 with the value 2. **What value is left at position 0**
> after the program halts?

Ok, first thing's first, condense the spec for Intcode:
1. Intcode programs consist of a one dimensional list of integers
   + Each element is called a "position"
   + Positions are numbered starting from 0
   + Input files are decimal encoded, separated by commas and arbitrary amounts
     of whitespace (including line breaks)
2. Execution begins at position 0
3. Positions may be treated either as an "opcode", or an argument to an opcode.
4. Opcode 1 accepts three arguments (in the next three positions): a, b, c
   + arguments represent positions
   + `c = a + b`
5. Opcode 2 behaves exactly like opcode 1, except `c = a * b`
6. Opcode 99 accepts no arguments, and causes the program to halt.
7. Other opcodes are illegal

Let's jump right in. First, we learn from our mistakes in day one by saving the
puzzle input to a file. Next, parse the puzzle input:

```python
def parse_intcode(text):
    return [int(x.strip()) for x in text.split(',')]

with open('day2.txt') as f:
    prog = parse_intcode(f.read())
```

Ok, next we implement the intcode interpreter:

```python
def execute_intcode(prog):
    pos = 0
    while True:
        opcode = prog[pos]
        if opcode == 1:
            a, b, c = prog[pos + 1:pos + 4]
            prog[c] = prog[a] + prog[b]
        elif opcode == 2:
            a, b, c = prog[pos + 1:pos + 4]
            prog[c] = prog[a] * prog[b]
        elif opcode == 99:
            break
        else:
            raise ValueError(f'Invalid opcode {opcode} at {pos}')
        pos += 4
```

Since the program is self-modifying, we should save the original state in case
we mess it up.

```python
prog_orig = [i for i in prog]
```

The last part of the puzzle text asks us to modify position 1 with the value 12,
and position 2 with the value 2 before we run the program.

```python
prog[1] = 12
prog[2] = 2
```

And finally, let's try it out!

```python
>>> execute_intcode(prog)
>>> prog[0]
12490719
```

Yay, That was correct! On to part 2...

> "Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! **Keep it nearby**
> during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers
> support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they
> are as you need them."

The next prompts define some terminology, and then lay out the next part of the
challenge:

> "With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the
> gravity assist, you need to **determine what pair of inputs produces the output**
> `19690720`."

The inputs to the program are the values at positions 1 (called the **noun**)
and 2 (called the **verb**), as given in part one, and they can range between 0
and 99, inclusive. The program output is in position 0 after the program halts.

The final answer to the puzzle is `100 * noun + verb`

So, this seems to be a brute force problem. There are two input symbols with 100
possible values each, so there are `100 ** 2 == 10000` combinations of input...

Let's get started!

```python
def brute_force(prog, val):
    from itertools import permutations
    for noun, verb in permutations(range(100), 2):
        prog_copy = [i for i in prog]
        prog_copy[1] = noun
        prog_copy[2] = verb
        execute_intcode(prog_copy)
        out = prog_copy[0]
        if out == val:
            return 100 * noun + verb
    return None
```

And, let's try it...

```python
>>> brute_force(prog_orig, 19690720)
2003
```

Hooray! Our gravity assist around the Moon was successful.

<h2 id="d3">Day 3: Crossed Wires</h2>

> Opening the front panel reveals a jumble of wires. Specifically, **two wires**
> are connected to a central port and extend outward on a grid. You trace the
> path each wire takes as it leaves the central port, one wire per line of text
> (your puzzle input).

The next part of the puzzle prompt defines a language for defining how these
wires run. It consists again of comma separated values, but this time it
consists of a directional prefix (**U**p, **D**own, **L**eft, and **R**ight)
followed by a decimal integer representing how many units the wire travels in
that direction.

Both wires begin from a "central port", and the challenge is to find the
[Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) between the
origin, and the nearest intersection of the two wires.

First, I think a more convenient form for these wires would be as a set of line
segments. Each line segment should be a 4-tuple, like `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. First
step then, is to parse the wire directions into a list of line segments:

```python
def parse_segments(line):
    segments = line.split(',')
    x, y = 0, 0
    out = []
    directions = {
        'U': lambda dist, x, y: (x, y + dist),
        'D': lambda dist, x, y: (x, y - dist),
        'L': lambda dist, x, y: (x - dist, y),
        'R': lambda dist, x, y: (x + dist, y),
    }
    for segment in segments:
        direction = segment[0]
        dist = int(segment[1:])
        x1, y1 = directions[segment[0]](int(segment[1:]), x, y)
        out.append((x, y, x1, y1))
        x, y = x1, y1
    return out
```

Now, we need to get all the intersections between all the segments of the first
wire and all the segments of the second wire. Let's first define a function
that will return the coordinate of the intersection between two segments, or
`None` if there isn't an intersection.

Two line segments will never intersect if they are parallel, so that should be
the first check. Then, we can get their theoretical intersection point by taking
the x component of the vertical line and the y component of the horizontal line.
(since in this problem the line segments can only be horizontal or vertical).

Finally, we check that the intersection point is within the bounds of each
individual segment.

```python
def is_vertical(seg):
    return seg[0] == seg[2]

def get_intersection(s1, s2):
    try:
        vert = [s for s in [s1, s2] if is_vertical(s)][0]
        horiz = [s for s in [s1, s2] if not is_vertical(s)][0]
        x, y = vert[0], horiz[1]
        if (x > horiz[0]) ^ (x < horiz[2]):
            return None
        if (y > vert[1]) ^ (y < vert[3]):
            return None
        return (x, y)
    except IndexError:
        return None
```

Now, iterate over all the possible combinations:

```python
def get_intersections(w1, w2):
    intersections = []
    for w1_seg in w1:
        for w2_seg in w2:
            intersection = get_intersection(w1_seg, w2_seg)
            if intersection is not None:
                intersections.append(intersection)
    return intersections
```

All together now:

```python
>>> with open('day3.txt') as f:
...     wires = [parse_segments(line) for line in f]
>>> intersections = get_intersections(wires[0], wires[1])
>>> closest = min(intersections, key=lambda x: abs(x[0]) + abs(x[1]))
>>> dist = abs(closest[0]) + abs(closest[1])
>>> dist
2427
```

And, there's always a part two!

> It turns out that this circuit is very timing-sensitive; you actually need to
> **minimize the signal delay**.

> To do this, calculate the number of steps each wire takes to reach each
> intersection; choose the intersection where the sum of both wires' steps is
> lowest. If a wire visits a position on the grid multiple times, use the steps
> value from the first time it visits that position when calculating the total
> value of a specific intersection.

Now, instead of minimizing the Manhattan distance, we have to minimize the
distance along the wire paths. To do that, we have to calculate it first!

```python
def on_segment(seg, point):
    if point[0] == seg[0] and point[0] == seg[2]:
        min_coord, max_coord = min(seg[1], seg[3]), max(seg[1], seg[3])
        coord = point[1]
    elif point[1] == seg[1] and point[1] == seg[3]:
        min_coord, max_coord = min(seg[0], seg[2]), max(seg[0], seg[2])
        coord = point[0]
    else:
        return False
    return coord > min_coord and coord < max_coord

def segment_len(seg):
    return abs(seg[2] - seg[0]) + abs(seg[3] - seg[1])

def wire_dist(wire, dest):
    dist = 0
    for seg in wire:
        if on_segment(seg, dest):
            dist += segment_len((seg[0], seg[1], dest[0], dest[1]))
            return dist
        else:
            dist += segment_len(seg)
    raise ValueError("dest does not intersect wire")

def loop_dist(w1, w2, dest):
    return wire_dist(w1, dest) + wire_dist(w2, dest)
```

And, to wrap it all up:

```py
>>> closest = min(intersections, key=lambda x: loop_dist(wires[0], wires[1], x))
>>> dist = loop_dist(wires[0], wires[1], closest)
>>> dist
27890
```

And that's day 3 done! Our fuel management system has been repaired.
