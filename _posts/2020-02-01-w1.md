I'm a little late to the party, but I heard about this from a fellow student,
and it happened to occur during a very hectic time for me personally. Still, I
wanted to work on it because it seemeed cute and fun!

<h2 id="d1">Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation</h2>

The first challenge is clearly about the [Rocket Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation).

Part one challenge:

> ...At the first Go / No Go poll, every Elf is Go until the Fuel Counter-Upper.
> They haven't determined the amount of fuel required yet.
>
> Fuel required to launch a given **module** is based on its **mass**.
> Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by
> three, round down, and subtract 2.
>
> ...
>
> **What is the sum of the fuel requirements** for all of the modules on your
> spacecraft?

Ok, easy enough:

```python
>>> def rocket_fuel(mass):
...     return (mass // 3) - 2
```

I attempted to use the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
module to get my puzzle input, but...

```python
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get('https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1/input')
<Response [400]>
>>> _.text
'Puzzle inputs differ by user.  Please log in to get your puzzle input.\n'
```

Well shoot, It might be easier just to copy-paste the puzzle input into the
interpreter...

```python
>>> text = """125860
... <pasted puzzle input>
... 132329
... 65057"""

>>> text
'125860\n66059\n147392\n64447\n72807\n136018\n144626\n68233\n130576\n92645\n52805\n79642\n74361\n98270\n110796\n62578\n58421\n125079\n52683\n144885\n148484\n113638\n125026\n112534\n125479\n51539\n122007\n60048\n67923\n76115\n144822\n115991\n133505\n85249\n142441\n90211\n87022\n68196\n117577\n58112\n116865\n108253\n127674\n93302\n58817\n126794\n89824\n134386\n99700\n125855\n119753\n64456\n68167\n88047\n127864\n146890\n71912\n128375\n134365\n91544\n104179\n84700\n95937\n78409\n94604\n130423\n98348\n87489\n105103\n94794\n123723\n134298\n88283\n59543\n53645\n89325\n109301\n143668\n96250\n130371\n140436\n95857\n98543\n91372\n137056\n142578\n116185\n96588\n93025\n122275\n99201\n110492\n109700\n106755\n120979\n60957\n134983\n130840\n132329\n65057'

>>> sum(rocket_fuel(int(x)) for x in text.split())
3427947
```

Which turns out to have been the correct answer for my input.

Part two challenge:

> During the second Go / No Go poll, the Elf in charge of the Rocket Equation

Ok, how about this

```python
>>> answer = _
>>> extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(answer)
... while extra_fuel > 0:
...     answer += extra_fuel
...     extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)

>>> answer
5141879
```

Nope! That would be too easy. How about this?

```python
>>> def calculate_rocket_fuel(module_masses):
...     def rocket_fuel(mass):
...         return (mass // 3) - 2
...     initial_fuel_requirement = sum(rocket_fuel(mass) for mass in module_masses)
...     total_fuel = initial_fuel_requirement
...     extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(initial_fuel_requirement)
...     while extra_fuel > 0:
...         total_fuel += extra_fuel
...         extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)
...     return total_fuel

>>> calculate_rocket_fuel(int(x) for x in text.split())
5141879
```

Still no... Hmm... Oh! I'm supposed to calculate the fuel requirements for each
module separately according to the challenge text.

```python
>>> def calculate_rocket_fuel(module_masses):
...     def rocket_fuel(mass):
...         return (mass // 3) - 2
...     total_fuel = 0
...     for mass in module_masses:
...         initial_fuel_requirement = rocket_fuel(mass)
...         module_fuel = initial_fuel_requirement
...         extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(initial_fuel_requirement)
...         while extra_fuel > 0:
...             module_fuel += extra_fuel
...             extra_fuel = rocket_fuel(extra_fuel)
...         total_fuel += module_fuel
...     return total_fuel

>>> calculate_rocket_fuel(int(x) for x in text.split())
5139037
```

That did it! Now we have the correct amount of fuel, and we're one step closer
to saving Santa!

<h2 id="d2">Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm</h2>

> On the way to your *gravity assist* around the Moon, your ship computer beeps
> angrily about a "*1202 program alarm*". On the radio, an Elf is already

Ha! Must have hit the [HCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire)
instruction. Anyway, I imagine we're supposed to do something about this... The
rest of the puzzle prompt details the operation of an "Intcode Computer". We're
supposed to implement a new one, and...

> Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity
> assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had
> just before the last computer caught fire. To do this,
> **before running the program**, replace position 1 with the value 12 and
> replace position 2 with the value 2. **What value is left at position 0**
> after the program halts?

Ok, first thing's first, condense the spec for Intcode:
1. Intcode programs consist of a one dimensional list of integers
   + Each element is called a "position"
   + Positions are numbered starting from 0
   + Input files are decimal encoded, separated by commas and arbitrary amounts
     of whitespace (including line breaks)
2. Execution begins at position 0
3. Positions may be treated either as an "opcode", or an argument to an opcode.
4. Opcode 1 accepts three arguments (in the next three positions): a, b, c
   + arguments represent positions
   + `c = a + b`
5. Opcode 2 behaves exactly like opcode 1, except `c = a * b`
6. Opcode 99 accepts no arguments, and causes the program to halt.
7. Other opcodes are illegal

Let's jump right in. First, we learn from our mistakes in day one by saving the
puzzle input to a file. Next, parse the puzzle input:

```python
def parse_intcode(text):
    return [int(x.strip()) for x in text.split(',')]

with open('day2.txt') as f:
    prog = parse_intcode(f.read())
```

Ok, next we implement the intcode interpreter:

```python
def execute_intcode(prog):
    pos = 0
    while True:
        opcode = prog[pos]
        if opcode == 1:
            a, b, c = prog[pos + 1:pos + 4]
            prog[c] = prog[a] + prog[b]
        elif opcode == 2:
            a, b, c = prog[pos + 1:pos + 4]
            prog[c] = prog[a] * prog[b]
        elif opcode == 99:
            break
        else:
            raise ValueError(f'Invalid opcode {opcode} at {pos}')
        pos += 4
```

Since the program is self-modifying, we should save the original state in case
we mess it up.

```python
prog_orig = [i for i in prog]
```

The last part of the puzzle text asks us to modify position 1 with the value 12,
and position 2 with the value 2 before we run the program.

```python
prog[1] = 12
prog[2] = 2
```

And finally, let's try it out!

```python
>>> execute_intcode(prog)
>>> prog[0]
12490719
```

Yay, That was correct! On to part 2...

> "Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! **Keep it nearby**
> during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers
> support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they
> are as you need them."

The next prompts define some terminology, and then lay out the next part of the
challenge:

> "With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the
> gravity assist, you need to **determine what pair of inputs produces the output**
> `19690720`."

The inputs to the program are the values at positions 1 (called the **noun**)
and 2 (called the **verb**), as given in part one, and they can range between 0
and 99, inclusive. The program output is in position 0 after the program halts.

The final answer to the puzzle is `100 * noun + verb`

So, this seems to be a brute force problem. There are two input symbols with 100
possible values each, so there are `100 ** 2 == 10000` combinations of input...

Let's get started!

```python
def brute_force(prog, val):
    from itertools import permutations
    for noun, verb in permutations(range(100), 2):
        prog_copy = [i for i in prog]
        prog_copy[1] = noun
        prog_copy[2] = verb
        execute_intcode(prog_copy)
        out = prog_copy[0]
        if out == val:
            return 100 * noun + verb
    return None
```

And, let's try it...

```python
>>> brute_force(prog_orig, 19690720)
2003
```

Hooray! Our gravity assist around the Moon was successful.

<h2 id="d3">Day 3: Crossed Wires</h2>

> The gravity assist was successful, and you're well on your way to the Venus
> refuelling station. During the rush back on Earth, the fuel management system
> wasn't completely installed, so that's next on the priority list.
>
> Opening the front panel reveals a jumble of wires. Specifically, **two wires**
> are connected to a central port and extend outward on a grid. You trace the
> path each wire takes as it leaves the central port, one wire per line of text
> (your puzzle input).

The next part of the puzzle prompt defines a language for defining how these
wires run. It consists again of comma separated values, but this time it
consists of a directional prefix (**U**p, **D**own, **L**eft, and **R**ight)
followed by a decimal integer representing how many units the wire travels in
that direction.

Both wires begin from a "central port", and the challenge is to find the
[Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) between the
origin, and the nearest intersection of the two wires.

First, I think a more convenient form for these wires would be as a set of line
segments. Each line segment should be a 4-tuple, like `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. First
step then, is to parse the wire directions into a list of line segments:

```python
def parse_segments(line):
    segments = line.split(',')
    x, y = 0, 0
    out = []
    directions = {
        'U': lambda dist, x, y: (x, y + dist),
        'D': lambda dist, x, y: (x, y - dist),
        'L': lambda dist, x, y: (x - dist, y),
        'R': lambda dist, x, y: (x + dist, y),
    }
    for segment in segments:
        direction = segment[0]
        dist = int(segment[1:])
        x1, y1 = directions[segment[0]](int(segment[1:]), x, y)
        out.append((x, y, x1, y1))
        x, y = x1, y1
    return out
```

Now, we need to get all the intersections between all the segments of the first
wire and all the segments of the second wire. Let's first define a function
that will return the coordinate of the intersection between two segments, or
`None` if there isn't an intersection.

Two line segments will never intersect if they are parallel, so that should be
the first check. Then, we can get their theoretical intersection point by taking
the x component of the vertical line and the y component of the horizontal line.
(since in this problem the line segments can only be horizontal or vertical).

Finally, we check that the intersection point is within the bounds of each
individual segment.

```python
def is_vertical(seg):
    return seg[0] == seg[2]

def get_intersection(s1, s2):
    try:
        vert = [s for s in [s1, s2] if is_vertical(s)][0]
        horiz = [s for s in [s1, s2] if not is_vertical(s)][0]
        x, y = vert[0], horiz[1]
        if (x > horiz[0]) ^ (x < horiz[2]):
            return None
        if (y > vert[1]) ^ (y < vert[3]):
            return None
        return (x, y)
    except IndexError:
        return None
```

Now, iterate over all the possible combinations:

```python
def get_intersections(w1, w2):
    intersections = []
    for w1_seg in w1:
        for w2_seg in w2:
            intersection = get_intersection(w1_seg, w2_seg)
            if intersection is not None:
                intersections.append(intersection)
    return intersections
```

All together now:

```python
>>> with open('day3.txt') as f:
...     wires = [parse_segments(line) for line in f]
>>> intersections = get_intersections(wires[0], wires[1])
>>> closest = min(intersections, key=lambda x: abs(x[0]) + abs(x[1]))
>>> dist = abs(closest[0]) + abs(closest[1])
>>> dist
2427
```

And, there's always a part two!

> It turns out that this circuit is very timing-sensitive; you actually need to
> **minimize the signal delay**.

> value of a specific intersection.

Now, instead of minimizing the Manhattan distance, we have to minimize the
distance along the wire paths. To do that, we have to calculate it first!

```python
def on_segment(seg, point):
    if point[0] == seg[0] and point[0] == seg[2]:
        min_coord, max_coord = min(seg[1], seg[3]), max(seg[1], seg[3])
        coord = point[1]
    elif point[1] == seg[1] and point[1] == seg[3]:
        min_coord, max_coord = min(seg[0], seg[2]), max(seg[0], seg[2])
        coord = point[0]
    else:
        return False
    return coord > min_coord and coord < max_coord

def segment_len(seg):
    return abs(seg[2] - seg[0]) + abs(seg[3] - seg[1])

def wire_dist(wire, dest):
    dist = 0
    for seg in wire:
        if on_segment(seg, dest):
            dist += segment_len((seg[0], seg[1], dest[0], dest[1]))
            return dist
        else:
            dist += segment_len(seg)
    raise ValueError("dest does not intersect wire")

def loop_dist(w1, w2, dest):
    return wire_dist(w1, dest) + wire_dist(w2, dest)
```

And, to wrap it all up:

```py
>>> closest = min(intersections, key=lambda x: loop_dist(wires[0], wires[1], x))
>>> dist = loop_dist(wires[0], wires[1], closest)
>>> dist
27890
```

And that's day 3 done! Our fuel management system has been repaired.

So we're making baby's first [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)!

Since our range is fairly small, I'm going to try just checking every integer
in this range against the given rules:

```python
def matches_rules(n):
    nstr = format(n, '06d')
    # never decreasing
    prev = 0
    for char in nstr:
        cur = int(char)
        if cur < prev:
            return False
        prev = cur
    # contains repeating digit
    prev = nstr[0]
    for char in nstr[1:]:
        if prev == char:
            return True
        prev = char
```

Now, we check the range...

```python
def count_matches(start, stop):
    matches = 0
    for i in range(start, stop):
        if matches_rules(i):
            matches += 1
    return matches
```

Now how many passwords do we need to check?

```python
>>> count_matches(245182, 790572)
1099
```

Oof. Maybe part two will provide us a solution?

> An Elf just remembered one more important detail: the two adjacent matching
> digits are not part of a larger group of matching digits.

Ok, so we just need to modify the `matches_rule` function to accomodate the new
rule.

```python
def matches_rules(n):
    nstr = format(n, '06d')
    # never decreasing
    prev = 0
    for char in nstr:
        cur = int(char)
        if cur < prev:
            return False
        prev = cur
    # contains repeating digit
    prev = nstr[0]
    run = 1
    pairflag = False
    for char in nstr[1:]:
        if prev == char:
            run += 1
            if run == 2:
                pairflag = True
            elif run > 2:
                return False
        else:
            prev = char
            run = 0
    return pairflag
```

Ok, so how many does that leave us with?

```python
>>> count_matches(245182, 790572)
476
```

Nope! That's incorrect... What did we do wrong?

> 111122 meets the criteria (even though 1 is repeated more than twice, it still
> contains a double 22).

Oops, we were too restrictive. Let's try this one more time...

```python
def matches_rules(n):
    nstr = format(n, '06d')
    # never decreasing
    prev = 0
    for char in nstr:
        cur = int(char)
        if cur < prev:
            return False
        prev = cur
    # contains repeating digit
    prev = nstr[0]
    run = 1
    for char in nstr[1:]:
        if prev == char:
            run += 1
        else:
            if run == 2:
                return True
            prev = char
            run = 0
    return run == 2
```

```python
>>> count_matches(245182, 790572)
516
```

That's still incorrect! Let's try a different tactic:

```python
def clump(iterable):
    clumps = []
    current_clump = [iterable[0]]
    for x in iterable[1:]:
        if x == current_clump[0]:
            current_clump.append(x)
        else:
            clumps.append(current_clump)
            current_clump = [x]
    clumps.append(current_clump)
    return clumps

def matches_rules(n):
    nstr = format(n, '06d')
    # never decreasing
    prev = 0
    for char in nstr:
        cur = int(char)
        if cur < prev:
            return False
        prev = cur
    # contains at least one clump size 2
    clumps = clump(nstr)
    pairs = [x for x in clumps if len(x) == 2]
    return bool(pairs)
```

```python
>>> count_matches(245182, 790572)
710
```

And that was the answer! It looks like defining the problem more explictly was
the key for me. On to Day 5

Well, looks like it's time to make our intcode interpreter a bit more robust.
Let's put it into a dedicated file of it's own with some `argparse` trappings:

```python
import argparse


def parse_intcode(text):
    return [int(x.strip()) for x in text.split(',')]


def execute_intcode(prog):
    pos = 0
    while True:
        opcode = prog[pos]
        if opcode == 1:
            a, b, c = prog[pos + 1:pos + 4]
            prog[c] = prog[a] + prog[b]
        elif opcode == 2:
            a, b, c = prog[pos + 1:pos + 4]
            prog[c] = prog[a] * prog[b]
        elif opcode == 99:
            break
        else:
            raise ValueError(f'Invalid opcode {opcode} at {pos}')
        pos += 4


if __name__ == '__main__':
    p = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    p.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'))
    args = p.parse_args()
    execute_intcode(parse_intcode(args.infile))
```

Ok, now what are the modifications we need to make?

Seems easy enough, let's add some conditions to the opcode handler:

```python
...
elif opcode == 3:
    # input
    a = prog[pos + 1]
    prog[a] = int(input()) # placeholder
elif opcode == 4:
    # output
    a = prog[pos + 1]
    print(prog[a]) # placeholder
...
```

But this brings up a problem with our current design, in that we now have
differently sized instructions. We can fix that easily enough by moving the
`pos` update statement from the end of the loop body to the end of each
instruction handler.

Now the second modification:

> **Second**, you'll need to add support for **parameter modes**:
>
> Each parameter of an instruction is handled based on its parameter mode. Right
> now, your ship computer already understands parameter mode `0`,
> **position mode**, which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a

>
> Now, your ship computer will also need to handle parameters in mode `1`,
> **immediate mode**. In immediate mode, a parameter is interpreted as a
> **value** - if the parameter is `50`, its value is simply `50`.
>
> Parameter modes are stored in the same value as the instruction's opcode. The

> digit, the second parameter's mode is in the thousands digit, the third
> parameter's mode is in the ten-thousands digit, and so on. Any missing modes
> are 0.

I think that *this* is a much less trivial modification. For maximum
future-proofing, I'm pretty much going to re-write the intcode interpreter from
scratch. After the description of the parameter modes modification, the
instructions state that

> Parameters that an instruction writes to will **never be in immediate mode.**

Which is great, becuase that wouldn't make any sense: how do you write to a
constant?

My rewrite consists of one main class for generic instructions, and subclasses
for each particular instruction:

```python
class Instruction:
    def __init__(self, opcode, prog, pos, verbose):
        self.prog = prog
        self.pos = pos
        self.opcode_val = opcode
        opcode //= 100
        param_modes = []
        for i in range(self.nargs):
            param_modes.append(opcode % 10)
            opcode //= 10
        self.param_modes = param_modes
        self.verbose = verbose

    def read(self, param):
        mode = self.param_modes[param]
        param_pos = self.pos + 1 + param
        if mode == 1:
            # immediate
            return self.prog[param_pos]
        elif mode == 0:
            # position
            return self.prog[self.prog[param_pos]]
        else:
            raise ValueError(f'Unknown parameter mode {mode} at {param_pos}')

    def write(self, param, val):
        mode = self.param_modes[param]
        param_pos = self.pos + 1 + param
        if mode == 0:
            # position
            self.prog[self.prog[param_pos]] = val
        else:
            # immediate is illegal for write parameters
            raise ValueError(f'Unknown parameter mode {mode} at {param_pos}')

    def run(self):
        rval = self._execute()
        return rval if rval is not None else self.pos + 1 + self.nargs
```

The subclasses each implement the `_execute` method. Each implementation uses
the `read` and `write` methods to evaluate the parameters of the instruction.
These methods enforce and implement the parameter modes defined in the prompt.

```python
class IntcodeAdd(Instruction):
    opcode = 1
    nargs = 3

    def _execute(self):
        self.write(2, self.read(0) + self.read(1))


class IntcodeMultiply(Instruction):
    opcode = 2
    nargs = 3

    def _execute(self):
        self.write(2, self.read(0) * self.read(1))


class IntcodeInput(Instruction):
    opcode = 3
    nargs = 1

    def _execute(self):
        self.write(0, int(input(f'In[{self.pos}]: ')))


class IntcodeOutput(Instruction):
    opcode = 4
    nargs = 1

    def _execute(self):
        print(f'Out[{self.pos}]: {self.read(0)}')


class IntcodeHalt(Instruction):
    opcode = 99
    nargs = 0

    def _execute(self):
        return False
```

These instruction subclasses are combined with with a function for decoding an
intcode instruction from the given program:

```python
instructions = {
    IntcodeAdd.opcode: IntcodeAdd,
    IntcodeMultiply.opcode: IntcodeMultiply,
    IntcodeInput.opcode: IntcodeInput,
    IntcodeOutput.opcode: IntcodeOutput,
    IntcodeHalt.opcode: IntcodeHalt,
}


def decode(prog, pos, verbose):
    opcode = prog[pos]
    return instructions[opcode % 100](opcode, prog, pos, verbose)
```

And finally, the main function that ties it all together and executes the whole
program:

```python
def execute_intcode(prog, verbose):
    pos = 0
    while pos is not False:
        inst = decode(prog, pos, verbose)
        pos = inst.run()
```

```bash
$ python3 intcode.py day5.txt
# In[0]: 1
# Out[10]: 0
# Out[20]: 0
# Out[50]: 0
# Out[72]: 0
# Out[94]: 0
# Out[116]: 0
# Out[138]: 0
# Out[160]: 0
# Out[206]: 0
# Out[220]: 3122865
```

And `3122865` is the correct answer! On to part two...

After some more charming spacecraft flavor, we discover that we need to add a
few conditional jump and comparison instructions to our intcode computer --
finally making it a [turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)
model of computation!

Let's tackle the `jump-if-true` instruction first. When defining our `run` and
`_execute` functions, we left some room for this behavior in anticipation of
this need:

```python
...
rval = self._execute()
return rval if rval is not None else self.pos + 1 + self.nargs
```

If the return value of `_execute` is not `None`, the `run` function just passes
it through. Otherwise, it computes the address of the next instruction to
execute and returns that instead. The `exectute_intcode` function uses this
return value as the index for the next instruction it executes.

We simply need to return `None` in the case that we don't jump, and the new
execution location in the case that we do:

```python
class IntcodeJumpIfTrue(Instruction):
    opcode = 5
    nargs = 2

    def _execute(self):
        if self.read(0) != 0:
            return self.read(1)
        else:
            return None
```

And that pretty much takes care of the `jump-if-false` instruction as well,
because all we need to do is change comparison from `!=` to `==`.

Next, we tackle the comparison instructions. They are pretty straightforward:

```python
class IntcodeLessThan(Instruction):
    opcode = 7
    nargs = 3

    def _execute(self):
        val = 1 if self.read(0) < self.read(1) else 0
        self.write(2, val)
```

And, in the same vein as the jump instruction, we simply change the comparison
from `<` in the `less than` instruction, to `==` in the `equals` instruction.

Then, we simply add the new instructions to the `instructions` dict, and we're
ready to go:

```python
instructions = {
    IntcodeAdd.opcode: IntcodeAdd,
    IntcodeMultiply.opcode: IntcodeMultiply,
    IntcodeInput.opcode: IntcodeInput,
    IntcodeOutput.opcode: IntcodeOutput,
    IntcodeJumpIfTrue.opcode: IntcodeJumpIfTrue,
    IntcodeJumpIfFalse.opcode: IntcodeJumpIfFalse,
    IntcodeLessThan.opcode: IntcodeLessThan,
    IntcodeEquals.opcode: IntcodeEquals,
    IntcodeHalt.opcode: IntcodeHalt,
}
```

The puzzle text says to use the same puzzle input, except that we should enter
`5` at the prompt:

```bash
$ python3 intcode.py day5.txt
# In[0]: 5
# Out[674]: 773660
```

And with that, the first five days of the challenge are complete! This has been
a lot of fun so far, even if I am now *...checks watch...* almost four months
late! "Real life" has been quite eventful recently, and I don't feel bad about
potentially taking another four months to finish the rest of this challenge.
